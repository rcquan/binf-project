## Connect to Database

## Picking Cases and Controls

### Filtering for First Day ICU Only

```{r, cache=TRUE}
query <- sql(
"SELECT DISTINCT subject_id
FROM mimic2v26.icd9
WHERE (code LIKE '995.9%' OR code = '785.52')
AND subject_id IN 
    (SELECT subject_id
    FROM mimic2v26.icustay_detail
    WHERE icustay_first_flg = 'Y' AND subject_icustay_seq = '1' AND icustay_age_group = 'adult')"
)
caseID <- tbl(db, query) %>%
    collect()
```

```{r, cache=TRUE}
query <- sql(
"SELECT DISTINCT subject_id
FROM mimic2v26.icd9
WHERE subject_id IN 
    (SELECT subject_id
    FROM mimic2v26.icustay_detail
    WHERE icustay_first_flg = 'Y' AND subject_icustay_seq = '1' AND icustay_age_group = 'adult')"
)
controlID <- tbl(db, query) %>%
    filter(!(subject_id %in% caseID$subject_id)) %>%
    collect()

```

## Microbiology Events

```{r}
# q <- sql(
# "SELECT *
# FROM mimic2v26.microbiologyevents
# LIMIT 500"
# )
# shit <- tbl(db, q)
```

## Demographic

```{r}
qDemographic <- sql(
"SELECT *
FROM mimic2v26.demographic_detail
LIMIT 500"
)
demographic <- tbl(db, qDemographic)
demographic %>% 
    select(subject_id, hadm_id, contains("descr"))

```
