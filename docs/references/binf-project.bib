  abstract = {Sepsis has been around since the dawn of time, having been described for more than 2000 years, although clinical definitions are recent. The consensus sepsis definitions have permitted worldwide epidemiological studies of sepsis to be conducted. We now recognize the common nature of sepsis and the consistency of its disease – particularly severe sepsis and septic shock. The incidence of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock continues to increase, and although Gram-positive bacterial pathogens remain the most common cause of sepsis, fungal organisms are increasing rapidly. We have made progress over the past half-century in identifying and treating patients with sepsis, and decreasing fatality rates reflect this progress. However, owing to the increasing incidence of sepsis, the number of people who die each year continues to increase. The mortality with sepsis, particularly related to treating organ dysfunction, remains a priority to clinicians worldwide and is deserving of greater public health attention.},

  abstract = {Sepsis and septic shock are common and potentially fatal conditions that often occur in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Early prediction of patients at risk for septic shock is therefore crucial to minimizing the effects of these complications. Potential indications for septic shock risk span a wide range of measurements, including physiological data gathered at different temporal resolutions and gene expression levels, leading to a nontrivial prediction problem. Previous works on septic shock prediction have used small, carefully curated datasets or clinical measurements that may not be available for many ICU patients. The recent availability of a large, rich ICU dataset called MIMIC-II has provided the opportunity for more extensive modeling of this problem. However, such a large clinical dataset inevitably contains a substantial amount of missing data. We investigate how different imputation selection criteria and methods can overcome the missing data problem. Our results show that imputation methods in conjunction with predictive modeling can lead to accurate septic shock prediction, even if the features are restricted primarily to noninvasive measurements. Our models provide a generalized approach for predicting septic shock in any ICU patient.},

DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study.
SETTING: Hospital Universitario San Vicente de Paul and Hospital General de Medellín, Medellín, Colombia. PATIENTS. Seven hundred thirty-four patients with suspected infection as main diagnosis for admittance into the emergency room.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratios (LR) of SIRS criteria at admission were determined using, as gold standards, the diagnosis at the time of discharge based on clinical history and evolution, and microbiological confirmation of infection. SIRS criteria were met by 503 patients (68.5\%); the discharge diagnosis of infection was found in 657 (89.4\%) and 276 (37\%) had microbiological confirmation. SIRS criteria exhibited a sensitivity of 69\%, specificity of 35\%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 90\%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 12\% and positive LR of 1.06. There were no differences between the two gold standards.
CONCLUSIONS: The finding of two or more SIRS criteria was of little usefulness for diagnosis of infection. It is necessary to work with new criteria and probably with biological markers, in order to obtain a simple, precise and operative definition of the sepsis phenomenon.},

Based on the non-invasive cardiovascular spectrum analysis, this paper presents a pilot study on the potential use of the nonlinear support vector machine (SVM) in the classification of the sepsis continuum into severe sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) groups. 28 consecutive eligible patients attending the emergency department with presumptive diagnoses of sepsis syndrome have participated in this study. Through principal component analysis (PCA), the first three principal components were used to construct the SVM feature space. The SVM classifier with a fourth-order polynomial kernel was found to have a better overall performance compared with the other SVM classifiers, showing the following classification results: sensitivity = 94.44\%, specificity = 62.50\%, positive predictive value = 85.00\%, negative predictive value = 83.33\% and accuracy = 84.62\%. Our classification results suggested that the combinatory use of cardiovascular spectrum analysis and the proposed SVM classification of autonomic neural activity is a potentially useful clinical tool to classify the sepsis continuum into two distinct pathological groups of varying sepsis severity.},

Insufficient development in both medical diagnosis and treatment of sepsis has led to continued growth in reported cases of sepsis over the past two decades with little improvement in mortality statistics. Efforts over the last decade to improve diagnosis have unsuccessfully sought to identify a "magic bullet" proteic biomarker that provides high sensitivity and specificity for infectious inflammation. More recently, genetic methods have made tracking regulation of the genes responsible for these biomarkers possible, giving current research new direction in the search to understand how host immune response combats infection. Despite the breadth of research, inadequate treatment as a result of delayed diagnosis continues to affect approximately one fourth of septic patients. In this report we review past and present diagnostic methods for sepsis and their respective limitations, and discuss the requirements for more timely diagnosis as the next step in curtailing sepsis-related mortality. We also present a proposal toward revision of the current diagnostic paradigm to include real-time immune monitoring.},

  abstract = {Objective
Trends in severe sepsis mortality derived from administrative data may be biased by changing ICD-9-CM coding practices. We sought to determine temporal trends in severe sepsis mortality using clinical trial data that does not rely on ICD-9-CM coding and compare mortality trends in trial data to those observed from administrative data.

Design
We searched MEDLINE for multicenter, randomized trials that enrolled patients with severe sepsis from 1991-2009. We calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMR) for each trial from observed 28-day mortality of usual care participants and predicted mortality from severity of illness scores. To compare mortality trends from clinical trials to administrative data, we identified adult severe sepsis hospitalizations in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 1993-2009, using two previously validated algorithms.

Setting and Patients
Hospitalized patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.

Measurements and Main Results
Of 3244 potentially eligible articles, we included 36 multicenter severe sepsis trials, with a total of 14,418 participants in a usual care arm. Participants with severe sepsis receiving usual care had a 28-day mortality of 33.2\%. Observed mortality decreased 3.0\% annually (95\% CI 0.8\%, 5.0\%, p=0.009), decreasing from 46.9\% {[}SMR 0.94, 95\% CI (0.86, 1.03){]} during years 1991-1995 to 29\% {[}SMR 0.53, (95\% CI (0.50, 0.57){]} during years 2006-2009 (3.0\% annual change). Trends in hospital mortality among patients with severe sepsis identified from administrative data {[}“Angus definition”: 4.7\% annual change, (95\% CI 4.1\%, 5.3\%), p=0.69), “Martin definition”: 3.5\% annual change, (95\% CI 3.0\%, 4.1\%, p=0.97){]} were similar to trends identified from clinical trials.

Conclusion
Since 1991, patients with severe sepsis enrolled in usual care arms of multicenter randomized trials have experienced decreasing mortality. The mortality trends identified in clinical trial participants appear similar to those identified using administrative data and support the use of administrative data to monitor mortality trends in patients with severe sepsis.},

  abstract = {While Electronic Medical Records (EMR) contain detailed records of the patient-clinician encounter — vital signs, laboratory tests, symptoms, caregivers’ notes, interventions prescribed and outcomes — developing predictive models from this data is not straightforward. These data contain systematic biases that violate assumptions made by off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms, commonly used in the literature to train predictive models. In this paper, we discuss key issues and subtle pitfalls specific to building predictive models from EMR. We highlight the importance of carefully considering both the special characteristics of EMR as well as the intended clinical use of the predictive model and show that failure to do so could lead to developing models that are less useful in practice. Finally, we describe approaches for training and evaluating models on EMR using early prediction of septic shock as our example application.},

  abstract = {Postoperative or posttraumatic sepsis remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in hospital populations, especially in populations in intensive care units (ICUs). Central to the successful control of sepsis-associated infections is the ability to rapidly diagnose and treat disease. The ability to identify sepsis patients before they show any symptoms would have major benefits for the health care of ICU patients. For this study, 92 ICU patients who had undergone procedures that increased the risk of developing sepsis were recruited upon admission. Blood samples were taken daily until either a clinical diagnosis of sepsis was made or until the patient was discharged from the ICU. In addition to standard clinical and laboratory parameter testing, the levels of expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α, FasL, and CCL2 mRNA were also measured by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. The results of the analysis of the data using a nonlinear technique (neural network analysis) demonstrated discernible differences prior to the onset of overt sepsis. Neural networks using cytokine and chemokine data were able to correctly predict patient outcomes in an average of 83.09\% of patient cases between 4 and 1 days before clinical diagnosis with high sensitivity and selectivity (91.43\% and 80.20\%, respectively). The neural network also had a predictive accuracy of 94.55\% when data from 22 healthy volunteers was analyzed in conjunction with the ICU patient data. Our observations from this pilot study indicate that it may be possible to predict the onset of sepsis in a mixed patient population by using a panel of just seven biomarkers.},

  abstract = {Objective In 1991, the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) convened a "Consensus Conference," the goals of which were to "provide a conceptual and a practical framework to define the systemic inflammatory response to infection, which is a progressive injurious process that falls under the generalized term 'sepsis' and includes sepsis-associated organ dysfunction as well. The general definitions introduced as a result of that conference have been widely used in practice, and have served as the foundation for inclusion criteria for numerous clinical trials of therapeutic interventions. Nevertheless, there has been an impetus from experts in the field to modify these definitions to reflect our current understanding of the pathophysiology of these syndromes. Design Several North American and European intensive care societies agreed to revisit the definitions for sepsis and related conditions. This conference was sponsored by the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM), The European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), the American Thoracic Society (ATS), and the Surgical Infection Society (SIS). Methods 29 participants attended the conference from Europe and North America. In advance of the conference, subgroups were formed to evaluate the following areas: signs and symptoms of sepsis, cell markers, cytokines, microbiologic data, and coagulation parameters.. The present manuscript serves as the final report of the 2001 International Sepsis Definitions Conference. Conclusion 1. Current concepts of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock remain useful to clinicians and researchers. 2. These definitions do not allow precise staging or prognostication of the host response to infection. 3. While SIRS remains a useful concept, the diagnostic criteria for SIRS published in 1992 are overly sensitive and non-specific. 4. An expanded list of signs and symptoms of sepsis may better reflect the clinical response to infection. 6. PIRO, a hypothetical model for staging sepsis is presented, which, in the future, may better characterize the syndrome on the basis of predisposing factors and premorbid conditions, the nature of the underlying infection, the characteristics of the host response, and the extent of the resultant organ dysfunction.},

  abstract = {The modern intensive care unit (ICU) has become a complex, expensive, data-intensive environment. Caregivers maintain an overall assessment of their patients based on important observations and trends. If an advanced monitoring system could also reliably provide a systemic interpretation of a patient's observations it could help caregivers interpret these data more rapidly and perhaps more accurately. In this thesis I use retrospective analysis of mixed medical/surgical intensive care patients to develop predictive models. Logistic regression is applied to 7048 development patients with several hundred candidate variables. These candidate variables range from simple vitals to long term trends and baseline deviations. Final models are selected by backward elimination on top cross-validated variables and validated on 3018 additional patients. The real-time acuity score (RAS) that I develop demonstrates strong discrimination ability for patient mortality, with an ROC area (AUC) of 0.880. The final model includes a number of variables known to be associated with mortality, but also computationally intensive variables absent in other severity scores. In addition to RAS, I also develop secondary outcome models that perform well at predicting pressor weaning (AUC=0.825), intraaortic balloon pump removal (AUC=0.816), the onset of septic shock (AUC=0.843), and acute kidney injury (AUC=0.742). Real-time mortality prediction is a feasible way to provide continuous risk assessment for ICU patients. RAS offers similar discrimination ability when compared to models computed once per day, based on aggregate data over that day.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:
Hospitalized patients who develop severe sepsis have significant morbidity and mortality. Early goal-directed therapy has been shown to decrease mortality in severe sepsis and septic shock, though a delay in recognizing impending sepsis often precludes this intervention.
OBJECTIVE:
To identify early predictors of septic shock among hospitalized non-intensive care unit (ICU) medical patients.
DESIGN:
Retrospective cohort analysis.
SETTING:
A 1200-bed academic medical center.
PATIENTS:
Derivation cohort consisted of 13,785 patients hospitalized during 2005. The validation cohorts consisted of 13,737 patients during 2006 and 13,937 patients from 2007.
INTERVENTION:
Development and prospective validation of a prediction model using Recursive Partitioning And Regression Tree (RPART) analysis.
METHODS:
RPART analysis of routine laboratory and hemodynamic variables from the derivation cohort to identify predictors prior to the occurrence of shock. Two models were generated, 1 including arterial blood gas (ABG) data and 1 without.
RESULTS:
When applied to the 2006 cohort, 347 (54.7\%) and 121 (19.1\%) of the 635 patients developing septic shock were correctly identified by the 2 models, respectively. For the 2007 patients, the 2 models correctly identified 367 (55.0\%) and 102 (15.3\%) of the 667 patients developing septic shock, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS:
Readily available data can be employed to predict non-ICU patients who develop septic shock several hours prior to ICU admission. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2010;5:19–25. © 2010 Society of Hospital Medicine.},
